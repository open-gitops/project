# OpenGitOps teams

## What and why

Community interest in GitOps and OpenGitOps project has continued to increase over the past several years. The OpenGitOps community is now large enough – and there are enough work products committed to – that the project work can not all be organized within the twice-monthly project meeting. Often these areas of focus will be worked on by only a subset of contributors. Teams have been a very functional solution to helping this work happen in a focused way while keeping the project as a whole on track. Every twice-monthly project meeting starts with a report by each of the teams, including new members. This could include you!

## Process

To join an existing team - [listed below](#list-of-teams) - it's a good idea to start by joining the twice monthly [project meeting](https://zoom.us/j/93779536510?pwd=TEFzbGRzREI3MVlkZmluemVkMEhHdz09) (1st and 3rd Wednesday - 19:00 GMT) and introduce yourself. You may skip this if you are unable to join those meetings. In either case, for transparency, open a PR adding yourself to the list below in [this file](./TEAMS.md), and in the PR description explain which team(s) you want to volunteer to join and why. All volunteers who are able to continue contributing are welcome to join any team. Once the PR is approved, the user should be added to the appropriate GitHub team in the [open-gitops](https://github.com/open-gitops) GitHub org as a last step before the PR is merged. New team members should be added to the next [project meeting agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hxifmCdOV5_FbKloDJRWZQHq0ge-trXJKF-BgV4wHVk/edit) so they can be welcomed to the project. 🦄

To propose a new team, open a discussion topic in the [github.com/open-gitops/project](https://github.com/open-gitops/project) repo, make a persuasive case, and invite feedback from others. If it's deemed within the scope of the WG, and there are others interested in contributing, from there a PR can be opened to create the team and add members in this file, below.

The status of proposed teams can be `proposed`, `active`, `paused`, or `inactive`. Be sure to keep the list below updated with a link to the currrent discussion, and active teams should have a link to meeting info for transparency and so anyone will be able to join if they wish.

Please [reach out in any of the available ways](https://github.com/open-gitops/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) with any questions. We welcome contributions from [everyone](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#community-members), and look forward to collaborating with you! 🙂💖🤝
